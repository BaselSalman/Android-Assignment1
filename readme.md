I've enhanced the quiz experience by implementing a user-friendly recycler view, featuring individual card views for each question along with their corresponding answer choices. With this new format, students can effortlessly scroll up and down to access any question they prefer and answer them at their own pace.
I've ensured that students can't proceed to the End Activity until they've answered all the questions. Upon answering a question, the radio buttons and submit button for that particular question are automatically disabled. This prevents students from changing their initial answer and encourages them to move on to the next unsolved question. Also, the app dynamically identifies the next unanswered question and automatically scrolls to it.
