Math Quiz for Elementary School Students
The same questions as Assignment 1 were used, but a recycler view was used now which contains card views and each card view consists of one question and its answers. You can scroll down and up to view other questions and answer anyone at any order, but of course the End Activity which contains the end screen of the app until all questions are answered. Once a question is answered, the radio buttons of the answers get disabled so as the submit button, so the user can't reanswer it again, then the app looks for the next unsloved question and scrolls down or up for it.
